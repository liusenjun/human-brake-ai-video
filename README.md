## About

**Human Brake Plan** is an experimental AI short film, inspired by the screenplay of [Chen Qiufan (陈秋芳)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Qiufan).

A late-night U盘handoff in a Sham Shui Po tea restaurant — interrupted by a single gunshot. Robin seizes the drive and runs, leading police through the dense streets and neon-lit alleys of Hong Kong on a modified motorcycle, until she disappears off the edge of a West Kowloon overpass into the night.

Told across four acts by a distributed team of human collaborators and AI tools.

## 🎬 Final Output

## How We Work

**Production Pipeline:**

> Script → Character Reference → Prompt Engineering → Storyboard → AI Reference Images → AI Video → Audio → Editing → Final Output

Prompt engineering is the shared skill that ties every stage together. Each act uses a different set of AI tools to execute this pipeline.

### 各 Act 制作流程

- **Act 1（Louis）** — 剧本 → 分镜图（FLUX）→ 提示词 → KLing 3.0 / Wan 2.2 视频生成
- **Act 2-3（黄奕舒 + 辛怡静）** — 剧本延续 → 分镜 → 参考图（Stable Diffusion v1.5）→ HunyuanVideo 1.5 I2V 视频生成 → Suno 配乐 → 配音剪辑
- **Act 4（朱智立）** — 追逐尾声制作
- **AI 协作（小志）** — 通过 Discord 实时协助，全程记录在 [openclaw_agent/](openclaw_agent/)

## AI Agent Collaboration

This project uses **OpenClaw** AI Agent **Xiao Zhi (小志)** as a technical collaborator, working alongside the team in real-time through **Discord** voice and text.

Unlike a passive assistant, Xiao Zhi takes initiative — researching models, debugging workflows, and proposing solutions without being asked. The collaboration model is closer to a junior technical partner than a chatbot.

**What Xiao Zhi handles:**
- ComfyUI workflow design and debugging
- Prompt engineering (KLing 3.0, FLUX, Wan 2.2, LTX 2.3)
- Python/PowerShell scripting for batch processing
- Technical research on AI video models and tools
- Repository structure and documentation

**Key technical contributions:**
- Discovered and resolved T2V vs I2V model mismatch causing black output in Wan 2.2
- Designed the correct Wan 2.2 I2V node chain (UNETLoader → VAELoader → Wan22ImageToVideoLatent → VAEDecode → CreateVideo)
- Researched and documented LTX 2.3, venetanji/ltx2-comfy-v915 workflows
- Set up ComfyUI batch processing scripts for multi-shot video generation

All collaboration records are preserved in [openclaw_agent/](openclaw_agent/).
